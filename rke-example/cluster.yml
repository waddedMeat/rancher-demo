# Example cluster.yml file

# see https://rancher.com/docs/rke/latest/en/example-yamls/
cluster_name: rke-cluster

nodes:
# RKE will ssh into servers to configure them
- address: node-1
  user: "vagrant"
  port: 22
  role:
    - controlplane
    - etcd
    - worker

# RKE runs the ingress as a daemonset (one on each node/server)
# It binds to port 80/443 on each node/server to expose applications
ingress:
  provider: nginx

# Note: Rancher runs EVERYTHING in docker containers
#       Any k8s "local" storage volumes will be created "inside" the kubelet container
#       You will have to bind host volumes to the kubelet for this feature to work as expected
#
#services:
#    kubelet:
#      # Optionally define additional volume binds to a service
#      extra_binds:
#        - "/usr/libexec/kubernetes/kubelet-plugins:/usr/libexec/kubernetes/kubelet-plugins"
