cluster_name: rke-cluster

nodes:
# RKE will ssh into servers to configure them
# Add more servers and run `rku up` to update the cluster
- address: 192.168.10.11

  port: 22
  role:
    - controlplane

# RKE runs the ingress as a daemonset (one on each node/server)
# It binds to port 80/443 on each node/server to expose applications
ingress:
  provider: nginx

# Note: Rancher runs EVERYTHING in docker containers
#       Any k8s "local" storage volumes will be created "inside" the kubelet container
#       You will have to bind host volumes to the kubelet for this feature to work as expected
#
#services:
#    kubelet:
#      # Optionally define additional volume binds to a service
#      extra_binds:
#        - "/usr/libexec/kubernetes/kubelet-plugins:/usr/libexec/kubernetes/kubelet-plugins"
